==========

A lost cities card game simulator


There are several AI examples in main.py.  This is not really a game, though I
suppose it could be used as an engine.


Note that this requires python3 to run. It was developed on python 3.3 (or maybe 3.4).


To run unit tests: `python3 -m unittest`


To run a simulated game try: `./main.py`.  There are also several examples of
AIs in `main.py`.  Note however that they might not all work, It is a goulash.
